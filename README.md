# 🌦️ Odin Weather App
Built by Lemuller04 as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum.

# 🚀 Project Overview
This weather app fetches and displays weather data for any location using the Visual Crossing Weather API. It was built to reinforce core skills in JavaScript, modular architecture, asynchronous programming, and DOM manipulation — all wrapped with a clean and responsive user interface.

# 💡 What I Learned
Modular JavaScript: Splitting logic into dedicated files (data.js, display.js, events.js) keeps code clean and maintainable.

Pub/Sub Architecture: Learned how to implement custom event handling using a lightweight publish-subscribe system (events.js).

Asynchronous Data Fetching: Practiced using async/await and handling API responses including basic error states (e.g. rate limits).

LocalStorage Caching: Optimized API calls by storing results locally and reusing recent data.

Responsive & Themed UI: Applied CSS variables and JavaScript-based theming based on time of day.

Form Input & Validation: Built a user-friendly location search form with input validation.

Real-Time Updates: Integrated setInterval() to keep the clock and background theme current.

# 🎯 Features
Live weather display including temperature, conditions, UV index, and sunrise/sunset.

Real-time local timestamp.

Day/night theme switching.

Responsive layout with clean typography and spacing.

Friendly error handling and loading message placeholder.

Optional features in development (weather icons, multi-day forecast cards, loading animations).

# 🧠 Next Steps
This is still a work in progress! Upcoming additions:

Add weather icons with dynamic imports.

Implement a “loading” spinner or animation during API calls.

Build out .days-container with forecast cards for multiple days.

Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
